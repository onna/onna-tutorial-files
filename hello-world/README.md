# About

In 6 minutes you can have a functioning Python program that authenticates against your Onna account,
creates a Datasource and retrieves data from a remote location.

You can see the output of this program when you login to your Onna account.

You can sign up for an Onna account by filling out the [registration form](https://register.onna.com/signup?trial=true "Onna trial account registration").
